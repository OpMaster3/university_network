This was a simulation of a University Network created using CISCO's Packet Tracer software.  

It includes the following:
* A Main Router - with admin privileges
* A Dorm Router - for residential buildings (2 Dorm building)
* An Academic Router - for academic buildings:
  * 2 Academic buildings
  * 1 Library building
  * 1 IT building
* A Switch connected to each router
* Wireless Access points at each building
* 3-5 end devices in each building
* An Email, DNS, and WEB server

This exercise was to practice creating and managing an small sized College Campus's Network topology,
ensuring security and efficiency.
